It starts with a deep understanding of a problem, goes through the careful design of the solution, the construction of the code, rigorous testing and ongoing maintenance. It is a discipline that applies engineering principles to the development of all types of software, from embedded systems in cars and household appliances to large cloud infrastructures and artificial intelligence. In our classes, for example, the projects go far beyond a simple \"app\":",

      "text": "In our classes, for example, the projects go far beyond a simple \"app\":\n\n- You will learn how to develop adistributed digital processing system. This involves creating software to solve complex problems using cloud architectures, with a focus on efficiency and reliability. It is the basis of services such as video streaming or large-scale social networks.\n- We also worked on building adigital platform based on service-oriented architecture, which means developing the \"skeletons\" behind systems that allow communication between different applications - something that a simple \"app\" alone can't do.\n- What aboutNatural Language Processing in text, video and audio?Here, you build systems that can \"understand\" human speech or text, something that ranges from virtual assistants to sentiment analysis on large volumes of data. This requires complex artificial intelligence solutions, not just user interfaces.\n- My experience as a teacher always shows me how dedicated students are to projects such assecure and fault-tolerant digital architecture. They need to think about how to protect systems from attack and how to ensure that they continue to function even if something goes wrong. This is the layer of security and resilience that underpins any technological solution.\n- Another important point is quality. In theResilient Digital Systemprojectwith quality as a software asset, you learn how to build automated tests that ensure the software delivers what it promises and works without unwanted surprises. It's a fundamental part of engineering.\n- And to ensure that all this reaches the user quickly and safely, you'll be working with theAgile Software Production Treadmill. This is a set of practices that speed up the development and delivery of new functionalities, ensuring that the technology is always up-to-date and relevant to the business.\n- Finally,Data architecture and governance aligned with corporate strategyshows that software engineers also deal with the organization and analysis of large volumes of data to help companies make strategic decisions. This is software engineering applied to business intelligence.",
