      "text": "The aim of the research was to investigate the application of video assessment activities as an alternative to stimulate self-reflection in technology courses, preventing students from resorting exclusively to ChatGPT to respond superficially to assessment activities. Carried out over two years, the research collected the perceptions of 53 Information Systems, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Computer Science students. The motivation was to explore methods that promote active student participation and develop communication skills, which are often neglected in exclusively textual or code-based assessments.",

In addition, despite the proposal encouraging the articulation of arguments and verbal communication, the majority of students still showed a preference for textual or coded assessments, which are more susceptible to the passive use of ChatGPT.",

      "text": "The study suggests that video-based assessment activities can be implemented to complement traditional assessments, with the aim of promoting communication skills and critical reflection. The research is relevant because it indicates that, although the use of ChatGPT can be beneficial, it is essential to find assessment methods that encourage a more active and reflective use of the tool, contributing to more meaningful learning.
