For the same cake, there may be recipes that are faster, use fewer ingredients or guarantee a better result. We study the most diverse \"recipes\" (algorithms) and programming techniques so that you know how to choose the best one for each type of problem, creating more efficient and intelligent solutions.\n- Algorithm Analysis:Here, we learn how to measure the \"cost\" of a solution. How long will a program take to run? How much computer memory will it consume? Understanding this is fundamental to creating systems that run quickly and stably, especially in large-scale applications such as social networks or banking systems.\n- Theory of Computation:This is the basis of everything. It's where we explore the limits of what is possible to compute. It may seem abstract, but it is this knowledge that allows our students to understand the deeper challenges of the field and contribute to the creation of truly new technologies.\n- Different Programming Paradigms:Just as there are different architectural styles for building a house, there are different \"styles\" for writing code. Each has its advantages and applications. By mastering various paradigms, professionals become much more versatile and prepared for any challenge.\n- Compilers:Have you ever wondered how a computer understands what a programmer writes? Compilers are the \"translators\" that transform the code we write into a language that the machine can execute. Understanding how they work is like a mechanic who not only knows how to drive, but understands how the engine works.\n- Artificial Intelligence in Practice: Inaddition to theory, our students get hands-on, exploring different branches of AI and developing projects that apply this knowledge to real-world situations.",
