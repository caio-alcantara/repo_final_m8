Face-to-face teaching for children goes far beyond the transmission of knowledge. It involves social interaction, empathy, building bonds and developing emotional skills. In adult education, there is more room for automation, especially in distance learning - which is growing not only in universities, but also in corporate education. Even so, face-to-face moments will continue to be important. People will continue to attend conferences, workshops and lectures with humans.",

In these cases, AI can significantly reduce the burden of administrative tasks - often seen as tiresome and bureaucratic.",
