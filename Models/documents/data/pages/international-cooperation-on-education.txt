TECH UNIVERSITY
WHO WE ARE
We are a pioneering institution created by André Esteves and Roberto Sallouti, both partners at BTG Pactual, Latin America’s largest investment bank, with a bold mission: empower the next generation of tech and business leaders in Brazil and the world.
WE BELIEVE TALENT IS EVERYWHERE — BUT OPPORTUNITY

At Inteli, we are bridging that gap through real-world, high-impact, and purpose-driven education.
OUR DNA
100% project-based learning
Real challenges from leading companies
Strong focus on leadership and soft skills
Global mindset, local action
OUR PARTNERS
We work hand-in-hand with top-tier companies to deliver real-world challenges and internships for our students:
TEACHING METHODOLOGY
PROJECT-BASED, MARKET-DRIVEN,
HUMAN-CENTERED
We don’t just teach technology—we teach how to lead with it. Our courses are built around real-world challenges from top companies, using a project-based learning (PBL) methodology, where students design full prototypes, pitch to executives, and develop essential skills in collaboration, leadership, and execution.
OUR PILLARS:
Learning through projects:
All subjects are integrated into multidisciplinary, real-world challenges.
Technical depth and business fluency:
Students master computing, business, and leadership simultaneously.
Soft skills and leadership:
Focus on collaboration, communication, creativity, and emotional intelligence.
